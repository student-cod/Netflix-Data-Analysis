Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed comprehensive exploratory analysis using Pandas and NumPy. This step focused on understanding the dataset's characteristics, discovering preliminary patterns, and formulating specific questions for deeper investigation.
Data Visualization: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations. Various chart types, including bar plots, scatter plots, and line charts, were generated to effectively illustrate key findings related to movie consumption, rating distributions, and popularity trends.

Key Insights Extracted:
Identified the movie with the highest recorded viewership based on the available data.
Determined the movie that received the top rating by examining the dataset's rating metric.
Pinpointed movies exhibiting the highest and lowest popularity scores within the dataset.
